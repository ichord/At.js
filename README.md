**An autocompletion library to autocomplete mentions, smileys etc. just like on Github or Twitter!** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ichord/At.js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ichord/At.js)

#### Notice

At.js now **depends on** [Caret.js](https://github.com/ichord/Caret.js) and will concat `Caret.js` into `dist/js/jquery.atwho.js`.

This branch has been updated to `v0.4.x`. Please read **CHANGELOG.md** for more details.  
English Documentation will keep improving. Maybe **you can do me a favor?**
